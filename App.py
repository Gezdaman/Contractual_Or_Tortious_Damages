#Project Brainstorming
#Now that you have an idea, visualize the end result:

#What does your program do? TELLS CLAIMANT WHETHER TO BRING CLAIM IN CONTRACT OR TORT
#How will it work in a terminal? YES
#Is it one player or two players? ONE
#Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.

#Make a timeline for yourself and avoid the temptation to build things that arenâ€™t required. 
#Setting firm boundaries and deadlines will keep you on track and prevent scope creep.

#The following tasks will help you identify natural breakpoints.

#Properly scoping your project will greatly benefit you; 
#scoping creates structure while requiring you to think through your entire project before you begin. 
#You should start with stating the goals for your project, then gathering the data, 
#and considering the analytical steps required. 
#A proper project scope can be a great road map for your project, 
#but keep in mind that some down-stream tasks may become dead ends which will require adjustment to the scope.
